# SandGears

SandGears is an interactive 2D sandbox simulation that allows users to experiment with mechanical contraptions and granular materials like sand. Play around with pistons, hinges, heaters, and more to create unique contraptions and observe their effects on the sand environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with SandGears, clone the repository and follow the instructions for building and running the project on your platform.

bash

`git clone https://github.com/your_username/SandGears.git`
`cd SandGears`

### Prerequisites
